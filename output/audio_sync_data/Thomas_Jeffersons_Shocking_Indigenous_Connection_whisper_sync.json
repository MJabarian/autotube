  "original_story": "[curious] Get this: recent DNA tests reveal Thomas Jefferson might be linked to the Powhatan tribe! This discovery rewrites history, challenging our views on Jefferson's racial beliefs. Born in 1743, he penned the Declaration of Independence, advocating liberty while enslaving over 600 people, including Sally Hemings, a woman of mixed heritage. Genetic evidence suggests a direct ancestry that reshapes our understanding of America's founding—was Jefferson a champion of freedom or a product of his time? The truth gets even murkier!
