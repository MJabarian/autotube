  "original_story": "[excited] Believe it or not, in 1879, Thomas Edison was ready to throw in the towel on the light bulb! But then, a random tweak in his filament material ignited a monumental breakthrough! He swapped out carbon for a new bamboo filament, which lasted over 1,200 hours. This flicker of innovation illuminated homes and transformed industries. Edison's perseverance turned an almost abandoned project into the foundation of modern lighting. Who knew one small change could light up the world and spark an electrical revolution?",
