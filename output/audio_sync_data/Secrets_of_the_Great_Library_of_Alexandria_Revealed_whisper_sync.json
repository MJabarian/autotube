In 48 BC, during Julius Caesar's siege, countless scrolls were lost, potentially erasing knowledge of entire civilizations! This library, home to works by Plato and Euclid, influenced thinkers for centuries. Scholars estimate it housed over 500,000 texts—enough to fill an entire city! We still debate what ancient wisdom vanished that day. Could it have changed the course of history? [pause:1s] Imagine the answers we’ll never know! ",
