  "original_story": "[excited] Get this - in 1984, President Reagan declared July as National Ice Cream Month! But wait, there’s more! The third Sunday is the official Ice Cream Day. Why? Turns out, it promotes the delicious treat's historical significance. Ice cream was a luxury for the elite until the 1800s, when it became more accessible. Did you know, Americans consume over 23 gallons of ice cream per person annually? That’s a lot of scoops! So, next time you enjoy a cone, remember its sweet, presidential roots!",
