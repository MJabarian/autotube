  "original_story": "[shocked] In the 19th century, some war heroes never set foot on the battlefield! Journalists like William Russell and Mark Twain crafted sensationalized accounts of conflicts, spinning tales so vivid that they became gospel to the public. [dramatic] But here’s the twist: many of them never witnessed the carnage firsthand. Instead, they relied on gossip, hearsay, and a vivid imagination. [curious] Imagine entire nations swayed by tall tales of heroism and despair, all to sell newspapers! [pause:0.5s] During the Crimean War, Russell’s reports sparked public outrage over military incompetence, changing the course of public opinion. [excited] And Twain? He wrote about the Civil War from afar, creating iconic characters no one ever met! This web of deception shows just how potent the printed word can be. [mysterious] So, what does this say about our modern media? Are we still being fooled by the stories we read? [pause:1s] The past may be fabricated, but the questions linger on…",
