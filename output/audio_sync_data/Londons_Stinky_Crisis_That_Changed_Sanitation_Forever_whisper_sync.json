  "original_story": "[dramatic] You won't believe this: in 1858, London was engulfed by the Great Stink! The Thames became a putrid cesspool, with raw sewage flowing into the river. Imagine a city gripped by a foul odor so intense it drove Parliament out of their sessions! This smelly crisis led to the development of a revolutionary sewer system designed by Joseph Bazalgette. He transformed public health, reducing cholera outbreaks by over 90%. Who knew a bad smell could spark such monumental change? [pause:0.5s]",
