  "story_title": "Einstein: The Secret Radical Behind Civil Rights",
  "original_story": "[excited] You won’t believe this—Albert Einstein wasn’t just a genius! In the 1930s, he secretly funded the NAACP, championing racial equality. He even collaborated with activist W.E.B. Du Bois! With his voice echoing through the halls of injustice, Einstein stood against segregation, calling it a ‘shame of our nation.’ His donations? Over $100,000 to uplift marginalized communities. Imagine the impact! This isn’t just about science; it’s about fighting for rights. What if Einstein’s legacy is more political than we realized?",
