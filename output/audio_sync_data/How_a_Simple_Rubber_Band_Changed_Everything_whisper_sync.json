  "story_title": "How a Simple Rubber Band Changed Everything",
  "original_story": "[excited] You won't believe what one man invented in 1845! Stephen Perry patented the rubber band, a tiny circle that changed industries forever. Before this, packaging was a hassle! Businesses struggled to keep items together, wasting time and money. Now, with this simple tool, factories, offices, and even schools found a quicker way to organize. Today, 50 million rubber bands are sold each year! That’s one small invention with a massive impact. Who knew something so simple could create such efficiency? [pause:0.5s]",
