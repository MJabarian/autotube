The writer, Richard Adams Locke, had everyone convinced this was real, and it sparked a frenzy of excitement. People were captivated! Over 100,000 copies flew off the shelves, proving how easily the public could be mesmerized by a good story. But here’s the kicker: it was all a hoax! What if we’re still falling for it today?
