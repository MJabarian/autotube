  "original_story": "[mysterious] What if I told you the genius we revere had a dark secret? In his early career, Albert Einstein may have borrowed ideas from lesser-known physicists, never giving them proper credit. Imagine a young Einstein, working in a patent office, surrounded by papers filled with revolutionary thoughts. [pause:0.5s] While he dazzled the world with theories of relativity, others—scientists like Henri Poincaré and others—had laid the groundwork, their brilliance overshadowed. [dramatic] In the shadows of his growing fame, whispers of betrayal lingered. [pause:0.5s] The very concepts that would earn him immortality were rooted in the neglected discoveries of others. [sad] The fear? That if this came to light, it would tarnish his legacy forever. [pause:1s] So next time you admire the genius of Einstein, consider the hidden stories of those who inspired him—voices that might still echo unheard. [curious] What if great minds aren’t born, but borrowed? Isn’t that a paradox of genius?",
