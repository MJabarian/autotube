  "story_title": "How the Printing Press Ignited a Knowledge Revolution",
  "original_story": "[excited] Get this – in 1440, Johannes Gutenberg changed everything! He invented the printing press, allowing books to be mass-produced for the first time. Before this, information was a luxury, accessible only to the rich. Suddenly, 200 copies of the Bible could be produced in weeks instead of years! This innovation fueled the Renaissance, spreading ideas like wildfire. Can you imagine a world where knowledge was locked away? Thanks to Gutenberg, literacy skyrocketed, and we’ve never looked back! Talk about a game-changer!",
