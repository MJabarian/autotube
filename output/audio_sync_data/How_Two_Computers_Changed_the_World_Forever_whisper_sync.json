  "original_story": "[excited] You won't believe it—1983 marked the birth of the Internet! When the first successful communication between two computers happened, a new era began. With the TCP/IP protocol, researchers at UCLA and Stanford connected, paving the way for global communication. This breakthrough transformed how we share information, connecting billions today. Fast forward to now, and over 4.9 billion people are online. That's nearly two-thirds of the world! Can you even imagine a life without the Internet? It's mind-boggling!",
