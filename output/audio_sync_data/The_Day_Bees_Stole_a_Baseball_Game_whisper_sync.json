  "story_title": "The Day Bees Stole a Baseball Game",
  "original_story": "[excited] Imagine the crack of the bat, the cheers of the crowd, then—chaos! In 1976, a swarm of bees descended on a baseball game in Massachusetts, turning America's favorite pastime into a frantic escape. Players dropped their bats, and fans scrambled for cover, ducking under seats and behind hot dog stands. The atmosphere shifted from excitement to panic as the buzzing cloud engulfed the field like an angry storm. Coaches waved their arms, trying to signal everyone to safety. A few brave souls even tried to shoo the bees away, but the buzzing beasts had other plans. After a tense suspension, players and fans alike watched in disbelief as nature interrupted their game. When the swarm finally dissipated, the game resumed—though I can assure you, a few players were playing a little more cautiously. It’s not every day that a baseball game takes a pause for a bee emergency! So, what’s the wildest thing you've seen disrupt a game? [pause:0.5s]",
