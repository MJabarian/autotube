  "story_title": "Secret Nuclear Tests: Shocking U.S. Government Experiments",
  "original_story": "[shocked] In the 1950s, the U.S. government secretly exposed over 200 soldiers to nuclear blasts! Operation Crossroads at Bikini Atoll aimed to study radiation effects on humans. Amidst the explosive tests, ethical concerns soared as servicemen unknowingly became human guinea pigs. Just two years later, 300,000 civilians in Nevada faced similar fates during atmospheric tests. Documents reveal that these actions were hidden from the public, raising questions about national security and human rights. Just how far did the government go for their experiments? [pause:1s]",
