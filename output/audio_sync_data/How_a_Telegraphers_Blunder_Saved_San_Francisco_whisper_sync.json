  "story_title": "How a Telegrapher's Blunder Saved San Francisco",
  "original_story": "[excited] You won’t believe how a simple mistake saved San Francisco! In 1906, a telegraph operator accidentally sent a message to the wrong fire station. Instead of spreading to packed neighborhoods, the flames were diverted. This miscommunication actually kept a devastating fire in check, preventing chaos in a city still reeling from the infamous earthquake just days prior. It’s wild to think that one clerical error saved countless lives and homes that day! Who knew a blunder could be heroic?",
