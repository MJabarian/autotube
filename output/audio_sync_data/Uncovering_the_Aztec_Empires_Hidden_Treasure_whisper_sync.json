  "original_story": "[mysterious] What if I told you the Aztec Empire hid a treasure worth $2 billion? In 1521, after the Spanish conquest, legend says Emperor Montezuma’s gold was buried to protect it. But only a fraction was ever found! Explorers like Hernán Cortés searched for it, but the secrets of its location vanished with the indigenous people. Today, cities like Mexico City sit atop ancient ruins, hiding unimaginable wealth just beneath our feet. Could you be standing on a treasure trove? [pause:1s] Seriously, how much more could be out there?",
