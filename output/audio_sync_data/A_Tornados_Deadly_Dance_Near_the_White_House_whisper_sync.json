  "story_title": "A Tornado's Deadly Dance Near the White House",
  "original_story": "[dramatic] In 1896, a tornado danced dangerously close to the White House! On August 6, this violent storm tore through Washington, D.C., with winds reaching up to 100 miles per hour. It didn’t just skip the presidential residence; it left a trail of destruction in its wake, damaging homes and uprooting trees nearby. The nearby Smithsonian Institution even reported significant damage to its roof. Imagine if that tornado had struck directly! President Grover Cleveland, who was in office at the time, might have faced an entirely different political landscape. With the storm causing chaos, it could have shifted public sentiment dramatically. Some estimates claim that if the tornado had hit the White House, it could have been a disaster affecting 30% of the political elite. The fact that history could have turned out so differently, thanks to a little twist of fate, is both terrifying and fascinating! What if that tornado had changed the course of American politics forever? [pause:1s]",
