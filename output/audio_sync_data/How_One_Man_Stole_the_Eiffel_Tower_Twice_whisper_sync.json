  "original_story": "[excited] You won't believe this - in 1925, a con artist named Victor Lustig convinced scrap dealers he could sell the Eiffel Tower! He forged documents and made off with tons of metal before authorities caught on. Once arrested, he escaped and tried again! Lustig pulled this off twice, making it a wild tale of deception. He even claimed to be a government official! Can you imagine swindling an entire monument? Talk about ambition! What if I told you the Eiffel Tower was nearly reduced to scrap? [pause:1s]",
