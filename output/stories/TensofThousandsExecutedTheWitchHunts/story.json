  "story": "[shocked] Imagine 60,000 innocent lives lost! Between 1450 and 1750, Europe was gripped by witch hunts fueled by paranoia.

Fear of the unknown morphed neighbors into enemies. These hunts exposed societal fractures, where superstition reigned over reason. What if I told you fear can turn a village into a killing ground? The truth about humanity's dark side is chilling.",
