  "story": "[shocked] On January 15, 1919, a tidal wave of molasses swept through the streets of Boston! Imagine a 2.3 million-gallon tank bursting, sending a thick, brown flood racing down Commercial Street at 35 miles per hour. This sticky disaster, known as the Great Molasses Flood, left 21 people dead and over 150 injured. Witnesses described the horrifying scene: houses rattled, and horses were trapped, struggling against the gooey tide. Local businesses were devastated, and the aftermath required over 100,000 man-hours to clean up. The cause? Structural negligence of the Purity Distilling Company, which faced lawsuits and public outrage. The disaster not only showcased the dangers of industrial negligence but also left a lasting imprint on the community. Today, locals still remember that fateful day, and the area remains notorious for its bizarre history. So, next time you think of molasses, remember that it once wreaked havoc, proving that even the sweetest things can have deadly consequences! [pause:1s]",
