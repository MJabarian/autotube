  "story": "[mysterious] What if the light bulb's true inventor was hidden in the shadows? In 1879, Thomas Edison lit up the world with his incandescent bulb, but it wasn’t all bright. Behind the scenes, he orchestrated a campaign to eclipse competitors like Nikola Tesla. Edison didn’t just invent; he manipulated public perception, branding his rival’s innovations as dangerous. Imagine a world where Tesla’s AC current could have dominated! Edison's tactics included smear campaigns and legal battles, effectively dimming Tesla’s brilliance. This rivalry wasn't just about light; it was a battle for the future of electricity itself. Edison's factories boomed, while Tesla struggled, living in poverty despite his genius. The irony? Tesla’s ideas eventually powered the modern world, but only after Edison's deceptive reign faded. So, was Tesla the true visionary, or was Edison just a master of marketing? In the glow of progress, who really switched on the light? [pause:0.5s] Sometimes, history isn't just about discovery; it's about who tells the story. What’s your take on this electric rivalry?",
