Story:
[excited] On November 9, 1989, a roar erupted in Berlin as the wall separating East and West crumbled! This 96-mile barrier had divided families and ideologies since 1961. Thousands flooded the streets, tearing down chunks of concrete, symbolizing the end of a repressive regime. The fall not only united Germany but sparked a wave of democratic uprisings across Eastern Europe, toppling regimes in Poland and Czechoslovakia. In just two years, the Soviet Union dissolved! Who would have thought a wall could bring about such monumental change? [pause:1s]
