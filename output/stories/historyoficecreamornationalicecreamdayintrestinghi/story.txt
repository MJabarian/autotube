[excited] Did you know ice cream was once a royal treat? In 1686, the first ice cream recipe appeared in Italy! Fast forward to 1984, when President Reagan declared July's third Sunday National Ice Cream Day. Why? To celebrate the delightful 20,000+ dairy farms in the U.S.! This day honors a creamy treat that was once reserved for the elite. Today, Americans consume over 23 pounds of ice cream per person yearly! So, next time you enjoy a scoop, remember its royal roots and tasty history!
