[excited] Get this - in 1984, President Reagan declared July as National Ice Cream Month! But why? Ice cream was a big deal back then, with Americans devouring 23 gallons per person annually! This delicious dessert dates back to ancient China, where they mixed milk and rice, but it really took off in the 17th century Europe. Today, July 16th is celebrated with ice cream festivities, reminding us that a scoop of joy is just a cone away! Who knew ice cream had such a sweet history?
