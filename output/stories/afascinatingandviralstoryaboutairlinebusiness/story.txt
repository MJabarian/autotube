[shocked] Get this - in 2019, a budget airline called WOW Air flew empty planes just to keep their slots at airports! They paid $4 million for the privilege of flying to popular destinations. Why? Because losing those slots would mean losing a chance to re-enter those markets later. This bizarre strategy led to nearly 30% of their flights taking off with no passengers. Just when you think airlines can’t get crazier, they pull a stunt like this! Amazing, right?
