[excited] Believe it or not, ice cream was once a royal treat! In 1686, Italian Francesco Procopio introduced it to Paris. The elite loved it, but it took until the 19th century for ice cream to hit the masses. Get this: on National Ice Cream Day, celebrated every third Sunday in July, Americans devour over 23 million gallons! That's enough to fill 35 Olympic-sized pools! So next time you indulge, remember: you're partaking in a dessert fit for kings... and a favorite of everyday folks too!
