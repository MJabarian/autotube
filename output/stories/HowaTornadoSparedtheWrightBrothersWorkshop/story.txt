[shocked] You won't believe this! In 1905, a fierce tornado roared through Dayton, Ohio, just blocks away from the Wright brothers' workshop. This wasn't just any storm; it was powerful enough to uproot trees and tear roofs off homes! But somehow, their vital experiments in aviation were untouched. Imagine if that tornado had struck? The invention of flight could have been delayed! Instead, the brothers continued their groundbreaking work, eventually making history with the first powered flight just two years later. Isn’t that wild?
