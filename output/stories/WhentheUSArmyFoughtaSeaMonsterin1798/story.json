  "story": "[curious] In 1798, a Massachusetts town faced a terrifying enemy: a gigantic sea serpent! Residents of Gloucester reported sightings of a 100-foot-long creature lurking off their coast. Panic swept through the town as whispers of its immense size spread. To protect the fearful citizens, local officials called on the U.S. Army for help. Yes, you heard that right! They mobilized soldiers to patrol the waters armed with cannons and muskets, ready to confront this mythical beast. Boats were dispatched, and fishermen nervously returned to shore, their nets empty. Historical accounts show that even the local newspaper printed detailed descriptions of the serpent, claiming it had a long, snake-like body and a formidable head. The frenzy reached such levels that some brave souls even tried to hunt it down! Ultimately, the creature was never found, but the legend of Gloucester's sea serpent lives on, raising the question: what really lurked beneath those waves? Were people just seeing shadows—or something more real? [pause:0.5s]",
