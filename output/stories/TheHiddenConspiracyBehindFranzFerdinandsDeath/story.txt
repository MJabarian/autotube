[mysterious] What if Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination was just the tip of the iceberg? On June 28, 1914, as the Archduke drove through Sarajevo, a bomb was thrown by a young nationalist, but that was only the beginning.

The Archduke’s death wasn’t just a tragic event—it was a catalyst for a global catastrophe. So, how deep does this conspiracy go? What if the truth was hidden in plain sight? This plot twist changed history forever.
