Story:
[dramatic] In 1894, a Jewish army officer was branded a traitor! Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully convicted of treason against France, exposing a dark underbelly of anti-Semitism. Picture the moment—a courtroom filled with tension, hushed whispers, and a verdict that would ripple through history. As a member of the French military, Dreyfus faced a staggering 75 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. The evidence? Fabricated documents and a blind adherence to prejudice. [curious] But the plot thickens! In 1898, writer Émile Zola penned an open letter, 'J'accuse,' igniting public outrage. Protests erupted as citizens questioned the integrity of their leaders and the military. [sad] By 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated, but not before the scandal revealed a nation divided. This shocking betrayal of justice affected generations and pushed France toward modern civil rights. [whispers] One question remains—how much has really changed since then?
