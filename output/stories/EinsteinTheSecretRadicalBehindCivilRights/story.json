Du Bois! With his voice echoing through the halls of injustice, Einstein stood against segregation, calling it a ‘shame of our nation.’ His donations? Over $100,000 to uplift marginalized communities. Imagine the impact! This isn’t just about science; it’s about fighting for rights. What if Einstein’s legacy is more political than we realized?",
