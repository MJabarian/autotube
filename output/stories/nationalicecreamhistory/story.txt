[excited] You won't believe that in 1776, ice cream became a national sensation at the signing of the Declaration of Independence! Founding Fathers like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were obsessed with this frozen treat. Jefferson even brought back a recipe from France! By the 19th century, ice cream was a luxury enjoyed by the elite, with flavors like vanilla and chocolate. Now, it’s a $13 billion industry in the U.S. alone! Who knew such a simple delight could have such a rich history?
