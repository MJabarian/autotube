[excited] Believe it or not, National Ice Cream Day was declared by President Ronald Reagan in 1984! This sweet holiday celebrates America’s favorite treat with a presidential twist. Reagan famously noted that 90% of Americans indulge in ice cream. Plus, he designated the third Sunday in July to enjoy it! But get this—ice cream consumption skyrockets in summer, with over 23 gallons consumed per person each year. So, next time you savor a scoop, remember: it’s not just dessert; it’s a presidential celebration!
