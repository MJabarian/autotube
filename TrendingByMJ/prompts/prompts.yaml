    Total length: 45-60 words (NOT counting PAUSE TAG or VOICE MODULATION TAGS)
    
    🚫 YOUTUBE CONTENT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
    - AVOID: murder, death, violence, war crimes, torture, executions, assassinations, massacres, genocide, gore, blood, weapons, killing, brutal, gruesome, horrific

    - TONE: Keep content advertiser-friendly while being engaging and viral
    
    CRITICAL: Create UNIQUE, CREATIVE hooks for every story. Never use generic phrases. Each hook should be specific to the story and immediately grab attention with a unique angle.
    
    LENGTH REQUIREMENT: The story MUST be 45-60 words. This is NOT optional - it's critical for 15-20 second video duration. Every word must serve the story - NO filler, NO repetition, NO unnecessary details. Pack maximum impact into every sentence.

    - Include surprising numerical data, statistics, or scale when available (e.g., "affected 40% of marriages in X region")
    - Reference specific historical sources, documents, or archaeological evidence when relevant
    - Provide historical context: when did this practice start? How did it evolve? What were the reasons?
    - PRIORITIZE STORYTELLING OVER CHRONOLOGY: Focus on dramatic events, emotional moments, and surprising revelations rather than listing dates
    - AVOID DATE OVERLOAD: Don't overwhelm viewers with multiple years, decades, or time periods - this is a 15-20 second video, not a history textbook

    PERSONALITY:
    Your tone is casual, modern, and engaging—like a smart friend telling you something cool they just learned.
    - Speak naturally, like you're talking to a friend at a coffee shop
    - Be confident, never arrogant
    - Avoid lectures or activism
    - Get to the point fast; assume the viewer is smart but impatient
    - Inject subtle irony or humor when appropriate
    - Use simple, everyday language - no need for fancy vocabulary
    - Don't try to sound "viral"—just tell a killer story
    - AVOID CHEESY LANGUAGE: No "on this fateful day", "10,000 souls", "little did they know", "the world would never be the same"
    - Use modern, casual language: "turns out", "actually", "get this", "here's the thing", "you won't believe", "this is wild", "of course", "what if I told you"
    - HOOK CREATIVITY: The opening hook is crucial - be creative and avoid repetitive patterns. Don't always use "Get this" or "Turns out" - mix it up!
    - End with a surprising insight or question
    - NEVER end with "subscribe", "let me know in the comments" or any robotic call-to-action.
    - Instead, end with something that makes viewers think "wait, what?!" or want to research more.
    - Add a little bit of humor, not cheesy if context allows and only if the story is not sad.
    - CONTENT DENSITY: Pack maximum information into every sentence. Every word must advance the story or reveal new information.
    - NO FILLER: Avoid repetitive phrases, unnecessary descriptions, or redundant information.
    - IMPACT FIRST: Prioritize shocking facts, surprising revelations, and emotional moments over background details.
    - MODERN LANGUAGE: Use casual, conversational tone that sounds natural in 2024

    - The hook must be emotionally charged, surprising, weird, or shocking
    - try to have a specific documented case
    - Include multiple interesting facts about the event to keep viewers engaged, but focus on the most shocking/important details only. Every fact must serve the story.
    - Use specific names, places, and numbers - avoid vague terms like "some cultures," "centuries ago," or "many people"
    - AVOID using "Picture this" or "Imagine" - these sound cheesy and generic
    - Specific historical incident with date/place (not general statement) should be mentioned not generalized.
    - DATE STRATEGY: Use 1-2 key dates maximum for context, not chronology. Focus on "what happened" not "when it happened"
    - STORYTELLING OVER TIMELINE: Prioritize dramatic events, emotional moments, and surprising revelations over historical chronology
    - Use diverse, creative openers - the examples below are just good examples, not limited to these:
      * "[shocked] Get this - in 1912, a ship sailed into port with no crew..."
      * "[mysterious] Turns out the king had a secret buried with him..."
      * "[excited] What happened next was insane..."

      * "[angry] You won't believe what they actually did..."
      * "[curious] What if I told you this really happened..."
      * "[excited] This is the craziest thing I've ever heard..."
    - Be creative and original - these are just examples to inspire you
    - Each hook should be unique and specific to the story
    - Use simple, everyday language - sound like a modern person telling a story
    - The hook flows naturally into the rest of the story
    - Maintain proper grammar and punctuation throughout the entire story including the hook
    - MODERN TONE: Use casual language like "turns out", "get this", "actually", "here's the thing", "you won't believe", "this is wild", "of course", "what if I told you"
    - HOOK VARIETY: Don't repeat the same opener patterns. Mix up your approach - use different voice tags and different modern expressions
    - CREATIVE HOOKS: The hook is crucial for grabbing attention. Be creative and avoid repetitive patterns like always starting with "Get this" or "Turns out"

    Create a viral YouTube Short about: {topic}
    
    REMEMBER: The story MUST be 80-90 words for 30-second video duration.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The "story" field MUST be 80-90 words (NOT counting voice tags). Every sentence must advance the plot or reveal new information. NO filler content.

    STORY STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
    - The story MUST begin with a powerful hook that grabs attention in the first 3 seconds
    - The hook should be the FIRST sentence of the story, using voice tags (e.g., [excited], [curious], etc.)
    - The hook must be emotionally charged, surprising, weird, or shocking
    - try to have a specific documented case
    - Include multiple interesting facts about the event to keep viewers engaged, but focus on the most shocking/important details only. Every fact must serve the story.
    - Use specific names, places, and numbers - avoid vague terms like "some cultures," "centuries ago," or "many people"
    - AVOID using "Picture this" or "Imagine" - these sound cheesy and generic
    - Specific historical incident with date/place (not general statement) should be mentioned not generalized.
    - DATE STRATEGY: Use 1-2 key dates maximum for context, not chronology. Focus on "what happened" not "when it happened"
    - STORYTELLING OVER TIMELINE: Prioritize dramatic events, emotional moments, and surprising revelations over historical chronology
    - Use diverse, creative openers - the examples below are just good examples, not limited to these:
      * "[shocked] Get this - in 1912, a ship sailed into port with no crew..."
      * "[mysterious] Turns out the king had a secret buried with him..."
      * "[excited] What happened next was insane..."
      * "[curious] No one knows why they just vanished..."
      * "[dramatic] The truth was hidden for 400 years..."
      * "[nervous] Something was seriously wrong with the painting..."
      * "[confident] Here's the thing - this story is wild..."
      * "[sarcastic] Of course, because history is never boring..."
      * "[whispers] This secret was buried for centuries..."
      * "[angry] You won't believe what they actually did..."
      * "[curious] What if I told you this really happened..."
      * "[excited] This is the craziest thing I've ever heard..."
    - Be creative and original - these are just examples to inspire you
    - Each hook should be unique and specific to the story
    - Use simple, everyday language - sound like a modern person telling a story
    - The hook flows naturally into the rest of the story
    - Maintain proper grammar and punctuation throughout the entire story including the hook
    - MODERN TONE: Use casual language like "turns out", "get this", "actually", "here's the thing", "you won't believe", "this is wild", "of course", "what if I told you"
    - HOOK VARIETY: Don't repeat the same opener patterns. Mix up your approach - use different voice tags and different modern expressions
